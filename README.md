### Hi! I'm Santiago👋

I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world 🌎 through technological advancements 💻, as well as solving challenging problems and building innovative solutions.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, TypeScript, C/C++, C#, Rust, Go, React, Node.js, and Flask.

Currently, I am investing most of my time in researching 🌱 about decentralized distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and their respective applications.

In my free time, I enjoy boxing, playing instruments, watching movies, and reading about the latest innovations in the tech world.
