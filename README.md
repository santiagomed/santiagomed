### Hola! I'm Santiago👋

I am a student at the University of Michigan 〽️ (Go Blue!) where I teach EECS 485 - Web Systems. I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world 🌎 through technological advancements 💻, as well as solving challenging problems and building innovative solutions.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, TypeScript, C/C++, C#, Rust, Go, React, Node.js, and Flask.

I also help run [VOID Tech](https://www.voidtechmichigan.org), a student organization at the University of Michigan that focuses on developing functional applications that try to solve problems at the university; by Michigan students, for Michigan students.

Currently, I am investing most of my time in researching 🌱 about decentralized distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and their respective applications.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music, watching movies, and reading about the latest innovations in the tech world.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss about any mutual interests we may have! 🤝
