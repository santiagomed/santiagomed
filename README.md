### Hi! I'm Santiago👋

I am currently a Software Engineer at X. I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world through technological advancements, as well as solving challenging problems and building innovative solutions.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, TypeScript, C/C++, C#, Rust, Go, React, Node.js, and Flask.

Currently, I am investing most of my time in reading about decentralized distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and their respective applications.

In my free time, I enjoy boxing, playing instruments, watching movies, and reading about the latest innovations in the tech world.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss any mutual interests we may have!
