### Hola! Soy Santiago👋

I am a student at the University of Michigan 〽️ (Go Blue!) where I teach EECS 485 - Web Systems. I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world 🌎 through technological advancements 💻, as well as solving challenging problems and building innovative solutions.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, TypeScript, C/C++, C#, Go, React, Node.js, and Flask.

Currently, I am investing most of my time in researching about Blockchain and dApp development, Artificial Intelligence, and their respective applications.
